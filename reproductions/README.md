# Reproductions

This directory contains reproductions of papers and published results as marimo notebooks.

## Structure

Each reproduction is a marimo notebook (`.py` file) in this directory:

```
reproductions/
├── example.py              # Example reproduction
├── paper_name_2024.py      # Paper reproduction
├── __init__.py
└── README.md (this file)
```

Run a reproduction with:

```bash
uv run marimo edit reproductions/example.py
```
