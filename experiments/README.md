# Experiments

This directory contains experimental code and research experiments as marimo notebooks.

## Structure

Each experiment is a marimo notebook (`.py` file) in this directory:

```
experiments/
├── example.py          # Example experiment
├── my_experiment.py    # Your experiment
├── __init__.py
└── README.md (this file)
```

Run an experiment with:

```bash
uv run marimo edit experiments/example.py
```
